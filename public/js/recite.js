 * Recitation: play a surah, and light the words as they are read.
 *
 * The audio is one file per surah, so where each ayah and word falls in it is
 * worked out ahead of time and shipped beside it as <nnn>.<recitation>.timing
 * .json. This module follows the clock and moves the highlight.
 *
 * There is no bar along the foot of the screen: the menu a word opens is the
 * player, so nothing takes a strip of the page from people not listening.
 * One highlight whatever the reason for it — a band is an ayah, coloured ink
 * is the word — so listening looks like the same page carrying on.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the mushaf data: every word carries its own ayah.
